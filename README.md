# My dotfiles for most of my common programs

## Automatic Setup:  
To automatically setup the dotfiles run from anywhere:  
```
./setup-files.sh
```  
This will keep the old configuration files around with a '.old' suffix  

**Options:**  
-d -- Don't keep '.old' files around; i.e. completely overwrite

### Sets up config for:
* <del>bash
* zsh
* vim
* tmux
* ranger
* termite
* zathura
