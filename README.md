# My dotfiles for most of my common programs

## Automatic Setup:  
To automatically setup the dotfiles run from anywhere:  
```
./setup-files.sh
```  

This will keep the old configuration files around with a '.old' suffix  
To delete the old files and compltely overwrite:
```
./setup-files.sh -d
```
